            <section>Chapati dough is typically prepared with flour and water, kneaded with the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to relax. After proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4pY2eG4yTc" target="hi">video..</a></section>

            <section>Key steps to making a veg biryani:
                Prepare the vegetables: Chop your desired vegetables like carrots, peas, beans, cauliflower, potatoes, etc., into bite-sized pieces. 
                Spice paste: Grind together ginger, garlic, green chilies, and a portion of your chosen spices (coriander, cumin, turmeric, red chili powder) into a paste. 
                Saut√© onions: Fry sliced onions until golden brown to add depth of flavor. 
                Cook the vegetables: Add the spice paste to the onions, then add the vegetables and cook until slightly tender. 
                Prepare the rice: Rinse basmati rice thoroughly and parboil it until almost cooked. 
                Layering: In a pot, spread a layer of the cooked vegetable mixture, then add a layer of parboiled rice, repeating until all ingredients are used, adding saffron-infused milk if desired. 
                Dum cooking: Seal the pot tightly with dough or a lid and cook on low heat until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors meld together.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXcXJZ2CuU" target="hi">video</a>

                Ingredients
Biryani can be made with a variety of ingredients, including basmati rice, goat, chicken, or beef, fried onions, ghee, and spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, bay leaves, nutmeg, papaya paste, caraway, mace flower, star anise, lemon, and saffron. 
Cooking
The cooking vessel is sealed to trap steam and cook the ingredients through a process called dum pukht. The bottom layer of the pot is often potatoes, which add moisture and brown well. 
Variations
Tehari is a vegetarian version of biryani that uses potatoes instead of meat.
